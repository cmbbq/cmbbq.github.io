## SDF on Palantir 
From Feb 3rd to Feb 10th 2025, Palantir's stock price rose nearly 40%.

Palantir, the America's biggest big data analytics company, is a basically a broligarch casino with secured orders from CIA, NSA, USIC and DoD.

Plantir is also the software arm of the Israeli military. It developed an AI system Lavendar that makes genociding easier for IDF. 

"I believe that, broadly, the IDF gets to decide what it wants to do and that they're broadly in the right.", says Peter Thiel, one of the co-founders of Palantir, PayPal, Anduril & OpenAI(Sam Altman credited him as "an amazing communicator"), defending Lavendar, an AI targeting system with 10% false positive rate, at Cambridge.

"The Enhanced Games", a pro-doping Olympics alternative, is also backed by Peter Thiel.

“There is no tech scene in China. There are no software companies!”, says Alex Karp, Palantir's CEO.

Palantir designed to 'power the West to its obvious innate superiority,' says CEO.


## Alexander Mercouris on Protectionism
The danger of protectionism is that it insulates and protects an industrial structure which, as a result, is gradually going to become more and more obsolete.

I've actually witnessed this in Britain. In the 1930s, Britain, which had previously advocated free trade, adopted protectionism on a large scale. It had a policy called Imperial Preference. Under this policy, the British Empire became a kind of unit which was providing raw materials to Britain, which had an industrial base. This industrial base operated behind high tariff walls and then exported the goods it produced to the rest of the empire. It was a very extractive system.

The result was that by the 1950s, Britain had become an industrial museum. I saw this firsthand. My earliest work as a lawyer was in the industrial sector. I did a lot of industrial work, which involved visiting British engineering factories. There were still a number of these factories in the 1980s, and I was shocked by how outdated they were. It was not uncommon to find machine tools in British engineering factories that dated back to the 19th century, and this was in the 1980s. So, it was completely obsolete.

Of course, when Britain was forced to fully open up its economy, all of these factories and industrial plants collapsed because they were so out of date that they could no longer function. This is the danger that the United States itself could face if it pursues protectionism at full speed, especially considering how concentrated the ownership of the US auto industry has become.

## Youtube Comments on Nezha2
I just watched it last night. This film transcends typical animation by diving deep into themes of good vs. evil, the duality of saints and demons, and the complexity of human nature. It challenges social norms, questions fate, and critiques blind conformity, making it a profound exploration of power, identity, and rebellion. Its bold storytelling and philosophical depth elevate it beyond entertainment to a thought-provoking masterpiece.

This movie chewed me up and spit me out. I was left in complete awe and wonder. Walking back to my truck I realized I had just witnessed a legendary movie up there with lord of the rings. It’s not often a movie can penetrate my black jaded heart anymore. I can’t remember the last time I was this blown away by a movie.

It is a film that can redefine what animation can be. It is easily the best animated movie I have ever seen, and I am not being hyperbolic saying that. It is no wonder it has already shattered the box office in China even before hitting the international screen. In an era of rushed sequels and profit-first projects, this film stands as a true testament to true artistic care and ambition. Visually, Nezha 2 is a masterpiece. The animation is jaw-dropping with every frame meticulously crafted to feel like a living painting. From the vibrant landscapes to the fluid, dynamic action sequences, the film elevates the art form to new heights, immersing you in a world that's both limitless and breathtaking. The action is equally phenomenal - every battle is a high-stakes, meticulously choreographed spectacle that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The choreography is so precise and expressive that clashes feel not only thrilling but also emotionally charged. While humor leans occasionally childish, it is more deliberate and well-paced than in the original, balancing the heavier moments without undercutting the film’s overall impact. What truly sets Nezha 2 apart, however, is the emotional depth. The story tackles weighty themes such as resurrection, destiny, and the struggle for acceptance with raw honesty that resonates deeply. It examines how the power of perceptions and the control of narratives can shape our lives, while weaving in a profoundly moving exploration of family and unconditional love. I found myself genuinely moved—even shedding tears during some of the quieter, more introspective moments. Ultimately, Nezha 2 is a groundbreaking achievement: an animated epic that delivers thrilling action and stunning visuals through a deeply resonant emotional journey. It is the kind of film that not only entertains but also lingers. If you haven’t seen the original, do yourself a favor and dive into Nezha 2 on the biggest IMAX screen possible. This is a cinematic experience you simply can’t miss. Go see it—it is nothing short of a revelation!

## Reddit on Trump's Executive Order
> President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order declaring that only the attorney general or the president, instead of federal regulators or bureaucrats, can speak for the U.S. when interpreting the meaning of laws carried out by the executive branch.

This is hilariously unworkable.
 - That's the point. Elon and Thiel want to collapse the United States.


## Reddit on Trump's Tweet
> Trump just posted: "He who saves his country does not violate any law."

And they keep telling us we're just being silly and paranoid...

He’s trying to justify breaking the law.
- I think, moreover, it sounds like some weird thing Elon would post.

Donald Trump just said Luigi did nothing wrong.

"When the president does it, then it is not illegal." -- Richard Nixon

Saves it from whom, for whom? As a lawyer, who takes comfort in rules and precedent as providing fundamental order, as the channel through which we resolve disputes about our respective rights and duties in our shared relation, it has pained me to say it, but I have been saying it since the original Trump administration: we have left the era of law and returned to an era, for a while, of naked politics. Arguments about what is the law have given way to what should be the law. And lawyers and citizens and anyone who cares may not responsibly now rely upon rules and precedents to make our arguments for us. We are now required to speak from the much more basic position of values. And this is a dangerous place to be, because it is in the contest of values that we are most at risk of violence.

## Reddit on ‘Long live the king!’
> Trump declares New York ‘saved’ from congestion pricing: ‘Long live the king!’

I recall that during Trump's first term, these kinds of bizarre statements would produce responses from Republican leaders that "he was just joking", "that's just locker room talk". Now we hear deafening silence from GOP members of Congress and others. They all seem perfectly willing to see how far Trump can push this absolute monarchy theme, and they'll ride his coattails right into a revolution.
- "trump can push this absolute monarchy theme". It's not a theme, it's real. They actually want this, they want all of it and can not get enough of it. They literally believe trump does not have enough power and should be able to bypass the checks and balances. The latest national Pew Research Center survey included: "In contrast, a 59% majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say many of the country’s problems could be addressed more effectively if Trump didn’t need to worry so much about Congress or the courts. Republicans who say they ‘strongly’ identify with the GOP are particularly likely to say the nation’s problems could be more effectively addressed by giving Trump more power: 78% say this."

## Reddit on the Minerals Deal
> ‘It’s blackmail’: Ukrainians react to Trump demand for $500bn share of minerals.

"Blackmail" implies Ukraine has done something wrong, and the US is trying to extract concessions in exchange for keeping quiet. What Trump and the Republicans are doing is simple extortion. Two-bit gangster shit, on the grandest scale possible.

> US threatens to shut off Starlink if Ukraine won't sign minerals deal, sources tell Reuters

A great way to tell other countries to don’t patronize Starlink because it will be a bargaining chip in future to exploit or extorting rackets.

## Curtis Yarvin, Pushing for an Autocratic Takeover of the US
Curtis Yarvin is a blogger known for founding the anti-egalitarian and anti-democratic philosophical movement known as the Dark Enlightenment or neo-reactionary movement (NRx). In his blog [Unqualified Reservations](https://www.unqualified-reservations.org), which he wrote from 2007 to 2014, and in his later newsletter [Gray Mirror](https://graymirror.substack.com), which he started in 2020, he argues that American democracy is a failed experiment that should be replaced by an accountable monarchy, similar to the governance structure of corporations, which is the belief that Elon, Peter Thiel, Steven Bannon, JD Vance, and Trump all subscribe to right now.

## USAID
The Musk investigations have begun to peer into the USAID complex. They reveal a system that Musk and President Trump postulate, is one fully designed to generate fraud.

The big picture however is not that USAID has been a sub-silo for CIA; that is not revelatory. What is revealing, however, is the evidence that USAID was so heavily involved in domestic influence operations. This latter aspect serves to highlight USAID’s relationship with the CIA and the fact that CIA, FBI, Dept. of Homeland Security and USAID were one big Intelligence Community structure, held together (in flimsy legal terms) by the Office of Director of National Intelligence (the role that Tulsi Gabbard will fill now she has been confirmed in post).

PS：和USAID类似的另一个组织，NED(National Endowment of Democracy) 还没被动。

## Feb 2025, the Turning Point
The Spectator magazine correctly observes that the head-spinning acceleration towards a new era is not confined to America, Canada, Greenland and Panama: “There is a wind of change blowing through the West. It emanates from Washington DC”, Gavin Mortimer writes.

A number of EU leaders congregated last weekend at a ‘Patriots for Europe’ (PfE) summit in Madrid. Geert Wilders declared: “We are living in an historic age, and my message to all the old leaders from Macron to Scholz, to your own Pedro Sánchez?: It’s time. It’s over now. They are history”.

Viktor Orbán said: “The Trump tornado has changed the world in just a few weeks … Yesterday we were heretics, today we’re mainstream”.

Marine Le Pen claimed that the West is “facing a truly global turning point".

## 历史转折
特朗普上台后：
1. 不计后果地暴力拆解建制派势力——根本不在意四年后对手可能的反扑。
2. 不遗余力地兑现选举承诺，谋求“权力意志”——即来自选民支持的“道德能量”。
3. 不留余地地全面战略收缩——过分轻率甚至轻蔑地背刺欧洲，引发美欧决裂，让“集体西方”成为历史名词。
4. 宣布只有特朗普和总检察长可以解释“法律的含义”。

这一系列激进施政和剧烈转向，意味着猝不及防中我们已经迎来一个新的历史转折。

### 无头官僚体系
现代美国行政制度是罗斯福政府遗留下来的无头官僚体系。联邦政府在罗斯福后迅速腐败肿胀，又受资本反复寄生夺魂，名义上是民主政体，实际上是半瘫痪——仅在遏华议题上高度协同的寡头体制。

对此，柯蒂斯·雅文给了一个比喻：“白宫对行政部门自上而下的控制就像对待一辆在雨中放了80年的自行车。包括特朗普本人在内的前几任共和党总统都曾拿起过它，与它合影，假装坐在上面，真的坐在上面等等。但没有人真正尝试骑过罗斯福的生锈的旧自行车。”

### 情报国家机器
现代美国行政官僚体系本已浮肿，其上又生长出一个不成比例的巨大肿瘤——由USAID、NED、CIA、DIA、NSA、FBI、ONI、CGI、INR、NRO、OICI、NGA、OIA、IB、ONSI、I&A、NSIC等情报机构组成的情报国家机器（intelligence apparatus）。

情报国家机器根深蒂固，名义上向国家情报总监（DNI）图尔西·加巴德汇报，实则各自是各自的独立王国。在历届政府中，都有裹挟白宫，甚至指示新手总统的实际权力。

### 新君主制
内有党争之忧，外有敌国之患，特朗普2.0政权的当务之急，自然是将美国行政体系从瘫痪状态中迅速恢复。如何才能迅速变革？自然不可诉诸民主，斩断绳结要靠亚历山大式的雄主，破而后立，还还要有正义性和哲学内核。

从特朗普2.0政权核心人物的行事逻辑、公开发言中可判断：他们在政治理念上高度趋同，隐隐统一在柯蒂斯·雅文的“新君主制”理论旗帜之下。

对于政治精英、硅谷科技精英、军工复合体、以及多数普通美国人来说，与其延续半瘫痪的犹太寡头政治，坐视被中国赶超，不如实行某种“可问责的君主制”——在美国政治语境中，当然不能明着支持君主制，但换种表述——“支持总统扩权，以硅谷初创公司CEO的效率去治理国家，从而对抗来自中国的全方位挑战”，则不难获得跨阶层、一定程度上跨党派的理性认同，激发出所谓的众望所归的“道德能量”。

“新君主制”甚至在法理上也没有太多障碍，因为三权分立在设计之初就留有余地，宪法并没有规定三权的先后序第，行政权在拯救国家时压过立法、司法，反而是国族危亡之际，健康生长的“权力意志”。
