## SDF on Palantir 
From Feb 3rd to Feb 10th 2025, Palantir's stock price rose nearly 40%.

Palantir, the America's biggest big data analytics company, is a basically a broligarch casino with secured orders from CIA, NSA, USIC and DoD.

Plantir is also the software arm of the Israeli military. It developed an AI system Lavendar that makes genociding easier for IDF. 

"I believe that, broadly, the IDF gets to decide what it wants to do and that they're broadly in the right.", says Peter Thiel, one of the co-founders of Palantir, PayPal, Anduril & OpenAI(Sam Altman credited him as "an amazing communicator"), defending Lavendar, an AI targeting system with 10% false positive rate, at Cambridge.

"The Enhanced Games", a pro-doping Olympics alternative, is also backed by Peter Thiel.

“There is no tech scene in China. There are no software companies!”, says Alex Karp, Palantir's CEO.

Palantir designed to 'power the West to its obvious innate superiority,' says CEO.


## Alexander Mercouris on Protectionism
The danger of protectionism is that it insulates and protects an industrial structure which, as a result, is gradually going to become more and more obsolete.

I've actually witnessed this in Britain. In the 1930s, Britain, which had previously advocated free trade, adopted protectionism on a large scale. It had a policy called Imperial Preference. Under this policy, the British Empire became a kind of unit which was providing raw materials to Britain, which had an industrial base. This industrial base operated behind high tariff walls and then exported the goods it produced to the rest of the empire. It was a very extractive system.

The result was that by the 1950s, Britain had become an industrial museum. I saw this firsthand. My earliest work as a lawyer was in the industrial sector. I did a lot of industrial work, which involved visiting British engineering factories. There were still a number of these factories in the 1980s, and I was shocked by how outdated they were. It was not uncommon to find machine tools in British engineering factories that dated back to the 19th century, and this was in the 1980s. So, it was completely obsolete.

Of course, when Britain was forced to fully open up its economy, all of these factories and industrial plants collapsed because they were so out of date that they could no longer function. This is the danger that the United States itself could face if it pursues protectionism at full speed, especially considering how concentrated the ownership of the US auto industry has become.

## Youtube Comments on Nezha2
I just watched it last night. This film transcends typical animation by diving deep into themes of good vs. evil, the duality of saints and demons, and the complexity of human nature. It challenges social norms, questions fate, and critiques blind conformity, making it a profound exploration of power, identity, and rebellion. Its bold storytelling and philosophical depth elevate it beyond entertainment to a thought-provoking masterpiece.

This movie chewed me up and spit me out. I was left in complete awe and wonder. Walking back to my truck I realized I had just witnessed a legendary movie up there with lord of the rings. It’s not often a movie can penetrate my black jaded heart anymore. I can’t remember the last time I was this blown away by a movie.

It is a film that can redefine what animation can be. It is easily the best animated movie I have ever seen, and I am not being hyperbolic saying that. It is no wonder it has already shattered the box office in China even before hitting the international screen. In an era of rushed sequels and profit-first projects, this film stands as a true testament to true artistic care and ambition. Visually, Nezha 2 is a masterpiece. The animation is jaw-dropping with every frame meticulously crafted to feel like a living painting. From the vibrant landscapes to the fluid, dynamic action sequences, the film elevates the art form to new heights, immersing you in a world that's both limitless and breathtaking. The action is equally phenomenal - every battle is a high-stakes, meticulously choreographed spectacle that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The choreography is so precise and expressive that clashes feel not only thrilling but also emotionally charged. While humor leans occasionally childish, it is more deliberate and well-paced than in the original, balancing the heavier moments without undercutting the film’s overall impact. What truly sets Nezha 2 apart, however, is the emotional depth. The story tackles weighty themes such as resurrection, destiny, and the struggle for acceptance with raw honesty that resonates deeply. It examines how the power of perceptions and the control of narratives can shape our lives, while weaving in a profoundly moving exploration of family and unconditional love. I found myself genuinely moved—even shedding tears during some of the quieter, more introspective moments. Ultimately, Nezha 2 is a groundbreaking achievement: an animated epic that delivers thrilling action and stunning visuals through a deeply resonant emotional journey. It is the kind of film that not only entertains but also lingers. If you haven’t seen the original, do yourself a favor and dive into Nezha 2 on the biggest IMAX screen possible. This is a cinematic experience you simply can’t miss. Go see it—it is nothing short of a revelation!

## Redditor on Trump's Executive Order
> President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order declaring that only the attorney general or the president, instead of federal regulators or bureaucrats, can speak for the U.S. when interpreting the meaning of laws carried out by the executive branch.

This is hilariously unworkable.
 - That's the point. Elon and Thiel want to collapse the United States.


## Redditor on Trump's Tweet
> Trump just posted: "He who saves his country does not violate any law."

And they keep telling us we're just being silly and paranoid...


He’s trying to justify breaking the law.
- I think, moreover, it sounds like some weird thing Elon would post.

Donald Trump just said Luigi did nothing wrong.

"When the president does it, then it is not illegal." -- Richard Nixon

Saves it from whom, for whom? As a lawyer, who takes comfort in rules and precedent as providing fundamental order, as the channel through which we resolve disputes about our respective rights and duties in our shared relation, it has pained me to say it, but I have been saying it since the original Trump administration: we have left the era of law and returned to an era, for a while, of naked politics. Arguments about what is the law have given way to what should be the law. And lawyers and citizens and anyone who cares may not responsibly now rely upon rules and precedents to make our arguments for us. We are now required to speak from the much more basic position of values. And this is a dangerous place to be, because it is in the contest of values that we are most at risk of violence.

## Redditor on ‘Long live the king!’
> Trump declares New York ‘saved’ from congestion pricing: ‘Long live the king!’

I recall that during Trump's first term, these kinds of bizarre statements would produce responses from Republican leaders that "he was just joking", "that's just locker room talk". Now we hear deafening silence from GOP members of Congress and others. They all seem perfectly willing to see how far Trump can push this absolute monarchy theme, and they'll ride his coattails right into a revolution.
- "trump can push this absolute monarchy theme". It's not a theme, it's real. They actually want this, they want all of it and can not get enough of it. They literally believe trump does not have enough power and should be able to bypass the checks and balances. The latest national Pew Research Center survey included: "In contrast, a 59% majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say many of the country’s problems could be addressed more effectively if Trump didn’t need to worry so much about Congress or the courts. Republicans who say they ‘strongly’ identify with the GOP are particularly likely to say the nation’s problems could be more effectively addressed by giving Trump more power: 78% say this."
