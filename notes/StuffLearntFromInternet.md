## SDF on Palantir 
From Feb 3rd to Feb 10th 2025, Palantir's stock price rose nearly 40%.

Palantir, the America's biggest big data analytics company, is a basically a broligarch casino with secured orders from CIA, NSA, USIC and DoD.

Plantir is also the software arm of the Israeli military. It developed an AI system Lavendar that makes genociding easier for IDF. 

"I believe that, broadly, the IDF gets to decide what it wants to do and that they're broadly in the right.", says Peter Thiel, one of the co-founders of Palantir, PayPal, Anduril & OpenAI(Sam Altman credited him as "an amazing communicator"), defending Lavendar, an AI targeting system with 10% false positive rate, at Cambridge.

"The Enhanced Games", a pro-doping Olympics alternative, is also backed by Peter Thiel.

“There is no tech scene in China. There are no software companies!”, says Alex Karp, Palantir's CEO.

Palantir designed to 'power the West to its obvious innate superiority,' says CEO.


## Alexander Mercouris on Protectionism
The danger of protectionism is that it insulates and protects an industrial structure which, as a result, is gradually going to become more and more obsolete.

I've actually witnessed this in Britain. In the 1930s, Britain, which had previously advocated free trade, adopted protectionism on a large scale. It had a policy called Imperial Preference. Under this policy, the British Empire became a kind of unit which was providing raw materials to Britain, which had an industrial base. This industrial base operated behind high tariff walls and then exported the goods it produced to the rest of the empire. It was a very extractive system.

The result was that by the 1950s, Britain had become an industrial museum. I saw this firsthand. My earliest work as a lawyer was in the industrial sector. I did a lot of industrial work, which involved visiting British engineering factories. There were still a number of these factories in the 1980s, and I was shocked by how outdated they were. It was not uncommon to find machine tools in British engineering factories that dated back to the 19th century, and this was in the 1980s. So, it was completely obsolete.

Of course, when Britain was forced to fully open up its economy, all of these factories and industrial plants collapsed because they were so out of date that they could no longer function. This is the danger that the United States itself could face if it pursues protectionism at full speed, especially considering how concentrated the ownership of the US auto industry has become.
