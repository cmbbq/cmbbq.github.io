I feel like recently I have been stuck in an evil cycle of mediocrity.

Every night, after work, at home, while driving or amid bathing, I feel wiped out and disinterested, do basically nothing, seek entertainment that is ultimately boring. This unholy cycle, like a while(1), is practically making life meaningless and short, in the name of relaxing and recharging oneself,

All the stimuli I seek, be it watching bilibili, douyin or youtube, or browsing bullshit Internet content, are somewhere between semi-garbage and absolute garbage, polluting not only my short-term cache, but also my life-long training set, stealthily shifting my personality, updating weights in my brain, turning me into another being, that is, so different, so bizarre.

I must break the cycle.

My brain definitely needs a break. It's struggling, yelling, cursing and crying for a reset, in my eternal internal INTJ dialogue.

Better be a stupid animal evolved on Earth, than a twisted soul from the Warpspace, It says.

My brain, fed with visual or auditory signals close to random white noise for too long, is in desperate need to rebuild its reward model.

I remember first time when I saw scenery never seen before.

I remember how damn addictively tasty when I first tried hot pot.

I remember how epic warcraft3 and diablo2 was, and how only by mentioning them makes me all nostalgic.

How come the freshness, the vividness, the appreciation of life, the praise to nature, the desire of knowledge, the ego, the nuts, all get lost?  

I gotta put a break in this while loop.

Hereby I swear, I shall not blindly chase after endless neuronal stimuli every single day non-stop. I'll do something different, learn something new, write something down, build something up, play with something that's real fun.

Stay healthy. Stay sick.
